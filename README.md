# logging_module

**Project Components**:

1. **Log Component (`log_component.py`)**: The Log Component serves as the central interface for external interaction with the logging system. This component manages the flow of log messages, offering a simple API for writing log entries.

    - **Key Features**:
      - **Write Method**: The core functionality of the system is exposed through the `write` method, allowing external modules and developers to add log messages to the system.
      - **File Handling**: The Log Component relies on a separate Log File object for efficient and organized file handling.

2. **Log File (`log_file.py`)**: The Log File module is responsible for handling the actual writing of log messages to log files. It incorporates sophisticated logic for managing log files, including rollover at midnight.

    - **Key Features**:
      - **Midnight Rollover**: The module contains logic to roll over log files at midnight, ensuring that log files don't become excessively large and are organized based on date.
      - **File Management**: Efficient file handling operations, including opening, closing, and flushing files, are essential for error-free logging.

3. **Testing Suite (`tests.py`)**: A comprehensive testing suite is developed using Python's built-in `unittest` framework. This suite verifies the correctness of the logging system by testing various components and functionalities.

    - **Key Tests**:
      - `test_write_logs`: This test checks if log entries are being correctly written to log files.
      - `test_midnight_rollover`: It verifies the functionality of midnight log file rollover.
      - `test_stop_behavior`: This test validates the stopping behavior of the logging system.

**Challenges and Issues**:

Despite the well-thought-out project structure and essential features, I've encountered several issues during the development phase.

1. **File Handling Errors**: The error messages "I/O operation on closed file" suggest that there are problems with file handling, potentially caused by file operations on already closed files. It's essential to review file handling code to ensure that files are managed correctly.

2. **Midnight Rollover Logic Issues**: The logic for rolling over log files at midnight appears to be problematic. Error messages indicate possible issues with handling dates and file names when implementing this critical feature.
